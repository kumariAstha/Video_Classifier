# Video-based Unusual Action Classification using Deep Learning Models         -in Progress
The Project aims to build a CNN based video classifier to classify videos into categories of Usual and Unusual human interactions by using different 2D and 3D architecture and come up with best possible accurate model.
##
First Stage: Collecting videos from various social media sites, you tube etc. The videos collected were of categories  Washing Laptop, Microwave Shoes, Microwave Phone, Blending Phone, Hammering Phone
##
Second Stage: Extracting the useful part from the video clip of duration(5-10 sec) and creating the dataset.
##
Third Stage: Building the classifier by incorporating different 2D and 3D architecture.
##
Final Stage: Testing with a new video data
